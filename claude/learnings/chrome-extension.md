# Chrome Extension Learnings (Manifest V3)

Practical lessons from building a Chrome extension with Vite, TypeScript, a side panel UI, content script injection, and service worker orchestration. Everything here is general-purpose — not specific to any particular domain.

## Manifest V3

**Service worker must declare `"type": "module"`** to use ES module imports:
```json
"background": { "service_worker": "dist/background.js", "type": "module" }
```

**`host_permissions` wildcard `*.domain.com` does not match the bare domain.** You need both patterns:
```json
"host_permissions": ["https://example.com/*", "https://*.example.com/*"]
```

**`icons` vs `action.default_icon`:** Both must be declared separately. `icons` is the store/extensions-page icon; `action.default_icon` is the toolbar button.

**`web_accessible_resources` glob `assets/*` does not match subdirectories.** Use `assets/**/*` or list paths explicitly. Extension pages (side panel, popup, background) can access their own assets via `chrome.runtime.getURL()` without declaring them here — `web_accessible_resources` is only for assets injected into web pages by content scripts.

**`homepage_url`** in the manifest becomes the "Website" link on the Chrome Web Store listing.

**`minimum_chrome_version`** — bump this when using newer APIs. For example, `chrome.sidePanel.close()` requires Chrome 141+; the side panel API itself was added in Chrome 114.

## Commands and Keyboard Shortcuts

**`_execute_action` ignores the `description` field** — it always shows "Activate the extension" in the Chrome shortcuts page. Use a named command instead for a custom description:
```json
"commands": { "toggle-sidepanel": { "description": "Toggle side panel" } }
```

**`suggested_key` is not active by default.** `chrome.commands.getAll()` returns an empty `shortcut` string until the user explicitly sets a binding on `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`. Show the `suggested_key` value as a hint in your UI; update via `chrome.action.setTitle()` once a shortcut is confirmed.

**No dynamic shortcut registration API exists.** Users must visit `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`. You can link there from your extension UI.

## Side Panel

**`sidePanel.open()` requires a user gesture context.** If you `await` anything before calling it, the gesture expires:
```ts
// WRONG — gesture lost after await
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener(async (tab) => {
  const details = await chrome.tabs.get(tab.id!);
  await chrome.sidePanel.open({ tabId: tab.id! }); // throws
});

// RIGHT — open first, then do async work
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener(async (tab) => {
  await chrome.sidePanel.open({ tabId: tab.id! });
  const details = await chrome.tabs.get(tab.id!);
});
```

**`sidePanel.close()` does NOT require a user gesture.** Call it freely from any async context.

**User gesture context does not transfer across `chrome.runtime.sendMessage()`.** A content script cannot ask the background to call `sidePanel.open()` — the gesture is lost at the message boundary. Valid triggers: toolbar icon click, keyboard shortcut, context menu item, button click on an extension page.

**Track side panel open/close state via port connection.** There is no direct API for "is the side panel open?" The side panel calls `chrome.runtime.connect({ name: "sidepanel" })` on load; the background sets `sidePanelOpen = true` in `onConnect` and `false` in `port.onDisconnect`.

## Service Worker Lifecycle

**The service worker shuts down after ~30 seconds of inactivity.** All module-level `let` variables reset on restart. Treat the service worker as stateless across time.

**When the SW shuts down, all open ports disconnect.** The `port.onDisconnect` event fires on the connected side (e.g., side panel). Implement a reconnect timer (~1 second) in the side panel's `onDisconnect` handler. Each `chrome.runtime.connect()` call wakes the SW, resetting its idle timer.

**SW restart causes phantom re-renders:** Every ~30s: SW dies → port disconnects → side panel reconnects → `onConnect` pushes cached results → side panel re-renders with identical data. Deduplicate by comparing message content before re-rendering.

**Distinguish SW restart from intentional reopen:** On SW restart, cached results are null (memory wiped). On user navigating to a different page and reopening, cached results may hold stale data. Use different source indicators to control whether to show a loading state.

**Initialization order matters with reconnect:** If `connectToBackground()` runs at module load time before a `let` variable it references is declared, the TDZ error is caught silently and `port.onDisconnect` is never registered, breaking reconnection permanently. Declare variables before any code that references them.

## Content Scripts — MAIN vs ISOLATED World

**`world: "MAIN"` is required to access page JavaScript objects** (game state, event listeners). The ISOLATED world has a separate JS context.

**`world: "ISOLATED"` for DOM-only watchers** that only need MutationObserver + `chrome.runtime.sendMessage()`. Safer because the content script can't be tampered with by page scripts. Note: TypeScript's type definitions may not include `"ISOLATED"` as a valid world value — cast with `as any`.

**Scripts injected via `executeScript({ files: [...] })` must not have `export` statements.** Vite outputs `export {};` by default. Strip it with a custom `generateBundle` plugin:
```ts
function stripExports(): Plugin {
  return {
    name: "strip-exports",
    generateBundle(_, bundle) {
      for (const [name, chunk] of Object.entries(bundle)) {
        if (name === "extract.js" && chunk.type === "chunk") {
          chunk.code = chunk.code.replace(/^export\s*\{[^}]*\}\s*;?\s*$/gm, "").trimEnd() + "\n";
        }
      }
    },
  };
}
```

## Message Passing

**Fire-and-forget messages:** Use `chrome.runtime.sendMessage().catch(() => {})` when sending from background to side panel. If the panel isn't open, `sendMessage` throws — the `.catch` silences it.

**Push-based > request/response** for background → side panel communication. The background pushes state changes; the side panel pushes user actions. Removing round-trips reduces complexity.

**`onMessage` handler returning `undefined` is fine** for synchronous handlers. The "return true" rule only applies if you call `sendResponse` asynchronously.

## Tab and Window Management

**`chrome.tabs.onActivated` does NOT fire on window switch.** Add `chrome.windows.onFocusChanged` to cover it:
```ts
chrome.windows.onFocusChanged.addListener(async (windowId) => {
  if (windowId === chrome.windows.WINDOW_ID_NONE) return; // Chrome lost focus
  const [tab] = await chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, windowId });
  // handle tab
});
```

**SPA navigation fires `tabs.onUpdated` with a `url` change but no `status`.** A handler that only checks `changeInfo.status === "complete"` silently ignores History API `pushState` navigation:
```ts
const isPageLoad = changeInfo.status === "complete";
const isSpaNav = changeInfo.url !== undefined && changeInfo.status === undefined;
if (!isPageLoad && !isSpaNav) return;
```

**`tabs.onUpdated` fires for all tabs.** Filter by active tab ID to avoid reacting to background tab loads.

## Icon Management

**Chrome does not persist per-tab icon state across tab switches.** When switching tabs, Chrome shows the default icon until you call `setIcon()` again. Re-apply on `onActivated`.

**`chrome.action.setIcon` with `imageData` avoids file I/O** — useful for smooth icon animations. Preload frames at startup using `OffscreenCanvas` + `fetch`. Keys must be size strings: `{ "16": ImageData, "48": ImageData }`.

**Passing `undefined` as `imageData` throws.** Guard against edge cases in animation math (e.g., division by zero producing `NaN` frame index).

## Storage

**`chrome.storage.local` is cleared on extension uninstall.** Use `chrome.storage.sync` for settings that should survive reinstalls.

**`chrome.storage.sync` works without Chrome sign-in** — it falls back to local behavior.

**Extension pages have `window.localStorage`** just like regular web pages. The background service worker does not. If only extension pages need persistence, `localStorage` works and avoids the `"storage"` manifest permission entirely.

## Vite Build Configuration

**Multi-entry build** with fixed filenames (no hashes — manifest must reference stable paths):
```ts
rollupOptions: {
  input: {
    background: resolve(__dirname, "src/background.ts"),
    extract: resolve(__dirname, "src/extract.ts"),
    sidepanel: resolve(__dirname, "sidepanel.html"),
  },
  output: {
    entryFileNames: "[name].js",
    chunkFileNames: "chunks/[name].js",
    assetFileNames: "assets/[name].[ext]",
  },
}
```

**`base: "./"` is required** for relative asset paths to work in the extension context.

**Assets outside `src/` are not automatically included by Vite.** Copy them with a `writeBundle` plugin:
```ts
{
  name: "copy-assets",
  writeBundle() {
    cpSync(resolve(__dirname, "assets/fonts"), resolve(__dirname, "dist/assets/fonts"), { recursive: true });
  },
}
```

**No HMR without `crxjs/vite-plugin`.** Without it, the dev workflow is: save → build → reload extension on `chrome://extensions`.

## Chrome Web Store Publishing

**External CDN resources are rejected.** The store blocks extensions that load scripts or fonts from external domains. Bundle everything locally (e.g., `.woff2` fonts via `@font-face`).

**A privacy policy URL is required** before submission, even for hobby extensions. A GitHub Pages page works.

**Store listing descriptions are plain text only** — no HTML, no Markdown, no clickable links.

**`homepage_url` in the manifest** becomes the "Website" link on the store listing. Requires republishing to take effect.

**Store icon sizing:** A full-bleed 128px icon looks cramped after Chrome applies its badge/shadow. Use internal padding (e.g., 96px content in 128px canvas).

**Promo assets:** 440x280 small tile appears in search results. 1400x560 marquee tile is only used if Google features your extension. Neither is required.

**One-time $5 developer fee** and email verification required before publishing.

## Permissions Cheat Sheet

| Permission | Required for |
|---|---|
| `activeTab` | Temporary access to current tab after user gesture |
| `tabs` | `chrome.tabs.get()`, `tabs.query()`, `tab.url` access |
| `scripting` | `chrome.scripting.executeScript()` |
| `sidePanel` | Side panel API |
| `storage` | `chrome.storage.local` and `chrome.storage.sync` (covers both) |
| `host_permissions` | Persistent `executeScript` on matching tabs without user gesture |
