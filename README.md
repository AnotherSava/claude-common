# Claude Code Skills

A collection of reusable [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) skills for implementation planning, PR workflows, and architecture documentation.

## Skills

---

### Plan Implementation

Interactive design discussion that produces a structured plan document before any code is written.

**Command:** `/plan-ralphex`

**Features:**
- Researches the codebase to understand current architecture and patterns
- Asks clarifying questions and discusses design trade-offs
- Iterates on the approach until you're satisfied
- Outputs a plan in `docs/plans/` with design decisions, file changes, and task breakdown

---

### Create PR

Squashes a feature branch into a single Conventional Commit, pushes, and opens a PR to main.

**Command:** `/pr-create`

**Features:**
- Reads the associated plan document and progress log for context
- Drafts a commit message explaining motivation and key decisions
- Asks for your approval before committing
- Rebases onto main before pushing so pr-merge can fast-forward
- Handles force-push when the branch was previously pushed with unsquashed commits

---

### Merge PR

Merges a PR locally via fast-forward to preserve your GPG-signed commits.

**Command:** `/pr-merge`

**Features:**
- Avoids GitHub's merge UI, which re-signs commits with GitHub's own key
- Fast-forwards main to the PR branch (rebases as fallback if needed)
- Stashes uncommitted changes and restores them after merge
- Cleans up remote and local branches, prunes stale remote-tracking refs

---

### Prepare PR

Analyzes plan-vs-implementation divergence before creating a PR.

**Command:** `/pr-prepare`

**Features:**
- Compares the most recent completed plan against the progress log and unpushed commits
- Surfaces unplanned additions, missing plan items, and design divergences
- Identifies review-driven changes in commit history
- Read-only analysis — does not modify files or create commits

---

### Update PR

Squashes new local changes into a single commit and pushes to update an existing PR.

**Command:** `/pr-update`

**Features:**
- Detects new changes since the last push (unpushed commits + uncommitted changes)
- Squashes them into a single GPG-signed Conventional Commit
- Rebases onto main and force-pushes with lease
- Appends an update summary to the PR description

---

### Commit

Analyzes changes and generates atomic Conventional Commit messages.

**Command:** `/commit`

**Features:**
- Reviews staged and unstaged changes, groups them into atomic commits
- Drafts commit messages in imperative mood with type prefixes
- Updates stale documentation and optimizes imports before committing
- Presents a full plan for approval before executing any commits
- GPG-signs all commits, never adds AI attribution

---

### Document Data Flow

Generates or updates a data-flow architecture document (`docs/data-flow.md`).

**Command:** `/document-data-flow`

**Features:**
- Discovers the project's architecture by exploring the codebase
- Produces step-by-step flow diagrams with data transition annotations
- Generates message/API protocol tables for all message types and endpoints
- Follows strict formatting rules for consistency across updates

---

### Review Summary

Summarizes a ralphex review — what was found, fixed, and dismissed.

**Command:** `/review-summary`

**Features:**
- Reads the most recent progress log from `.ralphex/progress/`
- Identifies committed but unpushed changes against `origin/main`
- Produces a concise summary: confirmed fixes, unaddressed concerns, and false positives

---

## Hooks

### Telegram Notification

Sends a Telegram message when Claude Code finishes a task and the user hasn't interacted for 60 seconds. Useful for long-running autonomous workflows.

**Location:** `.claude/hooks/notifications/telegram.py`

**How it works:**
- `UserPromptSubmit` hook records each prompt to `.claude/hooks/notifications/last_active` in the project directory
- `Notification` hook fires when Claude stops, waits 60 seconds, then checks if the user has been active since — if not, sends a Telegram message with the project name and last prompt

**Setup:** Create `.claude/hooks/notifications/.env` with:

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=...
```

---

## Global Installation

Skills, hooks, and settings in this repository are the originals. To make them available across all your projects, create symlinks in your global Claude Code config (`~/.claude/`) pointing to `.claude/skills`, `.claude/hooks`, and `.claude/settings.json` in this repo.

> If `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.claude/hooks`, or `~/.claude/settings.json` already exists, move it into the repo first (or remove it) before creating the symlink.

### Windows

Run from the project root *as Administrator*:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills" -Target ".claude\skills"
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\hooks" -Target ".claude\hooks"
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\settings.json" -Target ".claude\settings.json"
```

### Linux / macOS

Run from the project root:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/.claude/skills" ~/.claude/skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/.claude/hooks" ~/.claude/hooks
ln -s "$(pwd)/.claude/settings.json" ~/.claude/settings.json
```
